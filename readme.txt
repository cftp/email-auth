A plugin that uses email to authenticate WordPress users

== Description ==

The idea of this plugin is to allow the staff at an organisation to login to the WordPress website/intranet without having to remember a password. 

Secondly this method will prevent them from having to re-login too often. Thirdly this would prevent anyone without access to the specified email account from logging in (e.g. ex-staff would no longer have access to the website/intranet by virtue of their lack of access to staff email account).

The plugin relies on the organisation having confidence in the security of their email system. They therefore may not want to allow external email addresses (e.g. gmail or hotmail) during registration.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the InfinityTribes -> Config page and register on the network.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this secure?  =

It is as secure as your staff access to your email system. Or as secure as access to externals email systems if you allow those.
